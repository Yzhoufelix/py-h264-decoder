# H.264 Baseline Decoder

This project is for uOttawa course ELG5126.

The program is written in Python 3.5 with dependency:

    bitstring 3.1.5

The code is able to decode YCbCr values from i-frame in H.264 Baseline profile raw bitstream.

*Warning*. The code is supposed to be buggy and there's no recent plan to continue the development.
